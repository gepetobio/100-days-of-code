Finally the day I wanted to get to hahahaha! Today I worked mostly on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial. Nothing more than HTML, CSS and soon some JavaScript ;-)

### R2D1
Today I finished listening to [Evan You's interview on Software Engineering Daily (2015)](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/12/29/front-end-javascript-with-evan-you/) and ketp working on the [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) exercises. Tbh, I started following [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/) which will end up getting to the same exercises of the Frontend Masters course. I also found out a screencast app that will not cripple my computer (I had to do some screencasts for work today). Now I'll be able to finish my FreeCodeCamp Youtube video tutorial! I just need to find some quiet time in my place to do that ;-)
