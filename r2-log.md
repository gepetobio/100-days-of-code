## Log

### R2D34

Today I watched a bit of [JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-fundamentals-functional-v2/) course, reviewed the `this` keyword on JavaScript [Watch and Code: Practical JavaScript](https://watchandcode.com/courses/practical-javascript) and kept working on my Nuxt.js + Wordpress API project.

### R2D33

Today I started my Nuxt.js + Wordpress API project. Basic setup is done, scss working, now I'm just adding the required plugins to expose Advanced Custom Fields to the WP API and will start testing the endpoints with Axios.

### R2D32

Today I finished watching [JavaScript for WordPress](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-wordpress/wrapping-up-javascript-for-wordpress).

### R2D31

Today I kept following [JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-fundamentals-functional-v2/) course and worked on some of the exercises. I also started watching [JavaScript for WordPress](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-wordpress/wrapping-up-javascript-for-wordpress).

### R2D30

Today I kept following [JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-fundamentals-functional-v2/) course. I also read a bit of `this & Object Prototypes` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS).

### R2D29

Today I kept following [JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-fundamentals-functional-v2/) course and worked on some of the exercises.

### R2D28

Today I wasn't with my computer but tried to solve a couple of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) algorithms on my phone. An annoying bug didn't allow me to run the code but I did solve one of them later on on the computer. I also followed some of the first sections of [JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-fundamentals-functional-v2/) course.

### R2D27

Today I finally completed [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/) course! Some of the exercises were mind blowing!

### R2D26

Today I was really tired, had a long day away from the computer and ended up falling asleep watching [CS50](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) course.

### R2D25

Today I worked on some JavaScript algorithms challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

### R2D24

Today I followed a bit more of [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/) and restarted watching [CS50](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/)

### R2D23

Today I followed a bit more of [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/)

### R2D22

Today I worked on some async exercises of [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/)

### R2D21

Today I worked on some async exercises of [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) and also read a bit more in-depth documentation about the Event Loop.

### R2D20

Today I followed a bit more of [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/) and read a bit about Map, Filter and Reduce.

### R2D19
Today I followed a bit more of [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/) and read a bit about Recursion.

### R2D18

Today I worked on the last closure exercise of [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) and studied a bit more about how the Event Loop works. I can finally say that this concept is completely clear in my mind!!!

### R2D17

Today I worked on some closure exercises of [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) and almost finished the list.

### R2D16

Today I followed a bit more of [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/) and worked on some closure exercises of [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/). Writing down in a piece of paper how a small script behaves in terms of the Global Execution Context, Global Memory, Local Execution Context, Local Memory and Call Stack, Callback Queue and Event Loop is enlightening! I most definitely reached a brand new level of understanding of how JavaScript works! [@willsentance](https://twitter.com/willsentance)'s explanations were amazing!

### R2D15

Today I finished working on the callback exercises of [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/). I also reviewed some bits of `Scope & Closures` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) book to clarify how the JavaScript compiler works and the hoisting sequence (functions then variables). I also watched some bits of [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/).

### R2D14

Today I kept watching [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/) and I worked on some exercises proposed on the course [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) while reviewing it.

### R2D13

Today I finished watching the course [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) and kept working on the proposed exercises. I also re-started watching [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/) and reviewed some Functional Programming concepts.

### R2D12

Today I kept following the course [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) on [@FrontendMasters](https://twitter.com/FrontendMasters) and worked on some of the proposed exercises about Object.create and the `new` keyword.

### R2D11

Today I read a bit of the [Frontend Handbook 2018](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/) and had a quick look at some [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/) exercises.

### R2D10

Today I kept following the course [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) on [@FrontendMasters](https://twitter.com/FrontendMasters) and some [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/) exercises.

### R2D9

Today I kept following the course [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) on [@FrontendMasters](https://twitter.com/FrontendMasters) and working on the exercises. I also had the chance to sort out a real project bug using some of the Functional Programming strategies I've been a learning in the last months! I felt really great to see the application of something that, sometimes, feel a lot theoretical ;-)

### R2D8

Today I kept following the course [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) on [@FrontendMasters](https://twitter.com/FrontendMasters) and also joined the [@Codesmith](https://twitter.com/Codesmith) CSX Office Hours zoom meeting.

### R2D7

Today I'm also really tired but I've managed to work on some [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/) exercises. 

### R2D6

Today I had to drive for a while so I could listen to an [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) episode. In the end of the day, I was so tired that I could barely read a couple of paragraphs of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) but NO ZERO DAYS!

### R2D5

Today I read a bit of `this & Object Prototypes` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS),  worked on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial and kept working on [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/).

### R2D4

Today I did a bit of a review in a project I'm working with [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O) and kept working on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial. I also read a bit of `this & Object Prototypes` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS). I can't rush this book... the first two books of the series were not as dense as this one. I may even read it again once I'm done with it.

### R2D3

Today I read a bit of `this & Object Prototypes` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and worked on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial. I won't deny that I also had to spend some time doing some video editing apart from reviewing my explanations. So, not entirely coding per se...

### R2D2

Finally the day I wanted to get to hahahaha! Today I worked mostly on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial. Nothing more than HTML, CSS and soon some JavaScript ;-)

### R2D1

Today I finished listening to [Evan You's interview on Software Engineering Daily (2015)](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/12/29/front-end-javascript-with-evan-you/) and ketp working on the [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) exercises. Tbh, I started following [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/) which will end up getting to the same exercises of the Frontend Masters course. I also found out a screencast app that will not cripple my computer (I had to do some screencasts for work today). Now I'll be able to finish my FreeCodeCamp Youtube video tutorial! I just need to find some quiet time in my place to do that ;-)
