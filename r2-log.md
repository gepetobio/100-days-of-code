## Log

### R2D7
Today I'm also really tired but I've managed to work on some [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/) exercises. 

### R2D6
Today I had to drive for a while so I could listen to an [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) episode. In the end of the day, I was so tired that I could barely read a couple of paragraphs of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) but NO ZERO DAYS!

### R2D5
Today I read a bit of `this & Object Prototypes` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS),  worked on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial and kept working on [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/).

### R2D4
Today I did a bit of a review in a project I'm working with [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O) and kept working on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial. I also read a bit of `this & Object Prototypes` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS). I can't rush this book... the first two books of the series were not as dense as this one. I may even read it again once I'm done with it.

### R2D3
Today I read a bit of `this & Object Prototypes` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and worked on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial. I won't deny that I also had to spend some time doing some video editing apart from reviewing my explanations. So, not entirely coding per se...

Finally the day I wanted to get to hahahaha! Today I worked mostly on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial. Nothing more than HTML, CSS and soon some JavaScript ;-)

### R2D1
Today I finished listening to [Evan You's interview on Software Engineering Daily (2015)](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/12/29/front-end-javascript-with-evan-you/) and ketp working on the [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) exercises. Tbh, I started following [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/) which will end up getting to the same exercises of the Frontend Masters course. I also found out a screencast app that will not cripple my computer (I had to do some screencasts for work today). Now I'll be able to finish my FreeCodeCamp Youtube video tutorial! I just need to find some quiet time in my place to do that ;-)
