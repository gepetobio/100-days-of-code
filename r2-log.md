## Log

### R2D15

Today I finished working on the callback exercises of [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/). I also reviewed some bits of `Scope & Closures` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) book to clarify how the JavaScript compiler works and the hoisting sequence (functions then variables). I also watched some bits of [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/).

### R2D14

Today I kept watching [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/) and I worked on some exercises proposed on the course [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) while reviewing it.

### R2D13

Today I finished watching the course [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) and kept working on the proposed exercises. I also re-started watching [Functional-Light JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/) and reviewed some Functional Programming concepts.

### R2D12

Today I kept following the course [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) on [@FrontendMasters](https://twitter.com/FrontendMasters) and worked on some of the proposed exercises about Object.create and the `new` keyword.

### R2D11

Today I read a bit of the [Frontend Handbook 2018](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/) and had a quick look at some [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/) exercises.

### R2D10

Today I kept following the course [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) on [@FrontendMasters](https://twitter.com/FrontendMasters) and some [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/) exercises.

### R2D9

Today I kept following the course [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) on [@FrontendMasters](https://twitter.com/FrontendMasters) and working on the exercises. I also had the chance to sort out a real project bug using some of the Functional Programming strategies I've been a learning in the last months! I felt really great to see the application of something that, sometimes, feel a lot theoretical ;-)

### R2D8

Today I kept following the course [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) on [@FrontendMasters](https://twitter.com/FrontendMasters) and also joined the [@Codesmith](https://twitter.com/Codesmith) CSX Office Hours zoom meeting.

### R2D7

Today I'm also really tired but I've managed to work on some [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/) exercises. 

### R2D6

Today I had to drive for a while so I could listen to an [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) episode. In the end of the day, I was so tired that I could barely read a couple of paragraphs of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) but NO ZERO DAYS!

### R2D5

Today I read a bit of `this & Object Prototypes` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS),  worked on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial and kept working on [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/).

### R2D4

Today I did a bit of a review in a project I'm working with [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O) and kept working on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial. I also read a bit of `this & Object Prototypes` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS). I can't rush this book... the first two books of the series were not as dense as this one. I may even read it again once I'm done with it.

### R2D3

Today I read a bit of `this & Object Prototypes` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and worked on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial. I won't deny that I also had to spend some time doing some video editing apart from reviewing my explanations. So, not entirely coding per se...

### R2D2

Finally the day I wanted to get to hahahaha! Today I worked mostly on my FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial. Nothing more than HTML, CSS and soon some JavaScript ;-)

### R2D1

Today I finished listening to [Evan You's interview on Software Engineering Daily (2015)](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/12/29/front-end-javascript-with-evan-you/) and ketp working on the [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) exercises. Tbh, I started following [Codesmith CSX](https://csx.codesmith.io/) which will end up getting to the same exercises of the Frontend Masters course. I also found out a screencast app that will not cripple my computer (I had to do some screencasts for work today). Now I'll be able to finish my FreeCodeCamp Youtube video tutorial! I just need to find some quiet time in my place to do that ;-)
