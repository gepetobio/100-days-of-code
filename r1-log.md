# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Gledsley Müller

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 1st, Monday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D56
Today I read a bit of [JavaScript Allongé – the "Six" Edition](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read) and a bit of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) ES6 & Beyond. I also worked on the React version of my Local Weather app. Couldn't fix a bug... not sure what I'm doing wrong. Maybe tomorrow...

### R1D55
Today I read a chapter of [JavaScript Allongé – the "Six" Edition](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read) and followed along with the examples in the book.

### R1D54
Today I read a bit of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) ES6 & Beyond and worked on the React version of my Local Weather app. 

### R1D53
Today I had to prepare for another presentation on ES6 features so I read a bit of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) ES6 & Beyond and replicated some of the examples. I also read a bit of [JavaScript Allongé – the "Six" Edition](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read) and also replicated the code examples. I also refactored a function on my Local Weather app thanks to my friend [Željko Marinić](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeljkomarinic/)'s feedback.

### R1D52
Today it was a more theoretical study day. I read some bits of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and started reading [JavaScript Allongé – the "Six" Edition](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read). I did lots of the proposed exercises to follow along and learned some new things about JS along the way. I also worked a bit on the React Version of my Local Weather app.

### R1D51
Today I finished the jQuery version of my Local Weather app and starte the React version. I also started reading `this & Object Prototypes` [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) book.

### R1D50
Hurray, half way there!!! Today I finished the clean up on the [vanilla JavaScript version of my Local Weather app](https://codepen.io/gepetobio/full/vdyzjq/) and started the jQuery version. I also finished reading Scope & Closures [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) book.

### R1D49
Today I finished the styles and the icon functionality on my Local Weather app. Just need to clean up and refactor some things. I also read a bit of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) as usual.

### R1D48
Today I worked a bit more on my Local Weather app. Enabled the toggle functionality on the temperature and stared refactoring the markup and adding the new styles. I also read a bit of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) as usual.

### R1D47 
Today I worked on my Local Weather app and did a presentation about ES6 features to the other developers of the company I work for. It was really cool as most of them are PHP developers and but know enough of JavaScript but haven't really learned ES6 new features. I also read a bit of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) as usual.

### R1D46
Today I fixed a minor bug on the VueJS version of my Random Quote Machine app. I also I worked on my Local Weather app (Vanilla JS version). For personal reasons, I spent a long time researching how to create Chrome extensions and how to parse an HTML table to OSX format. I may need to create this extension at some point in the following week or so. I also read a bit of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) as usual.

### R1D45 
Once more, today I read a bit of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and did more functional programming exercises with the nodeschool Functional JavaScript workshop. Also did a code review session with [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O). Tomorrow I'll probably get back to my Local Weather app.

### R1D44 
Same as yesterday, today I read a bit of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and did more functional programming exercises with the nodeschool Functional JavaScript workshop.

### R1D43 
Today, again, I read a bit of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and did more functional programming exercises with the nodeschool Functional JavaScript workshop.

### R1D42
Today I read some bits of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and did some functional programming exercises with the nodeschool Functional JavaScript workshop.

### R1D41
Today I read a lot of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) as I didn't have my computer with me. But in the end I've managed to setup a netbook with git and vim and I had a chance to do some node.js exercises.

### R1D40
Today I worked a bit more on my Local Weather app. Already displaying the location (city), the temperature and the description of the weather. I also read some bits of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS).

### R1D39
Today I worked on my Local Weather app in vanilla JavaScript. Integrated the API and tomorrow I'll start working on the markup and styles. I also read some bits of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS). And I realised I had duplicated R1D33 on my logs so today is in fact Day 39.

### R1D38
Today I read a bit of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and replaced API on my Random Quote Machine versions. I also started a Show the Local Weather app challenge on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). I also found out that [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O) got [his FCC Frontend Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/artoodeeto/front-end-certification) and I'm really proud of him!!!

### R1D37
Today I studied a bit of Functional Programming (Monads) and I finished the VueJS version of my Random Quote Machine. I also started changing the API because the original one is quote unreliable. I'll push all the new versions live and to codepen tomorrow. I also read some bits of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS).

### R1D36
Today I studied and did a lot of Functional Programming exercises: Functors, Monads, Curring, Partial Application, Memoization and Transducers. I also read some bits of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS).

### R1D35
Today I studied a bit of Functional Programming and tried to debug my VueJS app... still no luck :-(

### R1D34
Today I worked on my Random Quote Machine VueJS implementation. I just need to sort out a bug and then I'm done with it!

### R1D33
Today I just watched some VueJS tutorials to get the differences with React. I also read a bit more of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS). I got sidetracked again with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) tutorials and testing a new microphone. 

### R1D32
Today I read a bit more of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and practice some of the examples. I also studied a bit of VueJS to get my Random Quote Machine version working. I'm thinkinb about streaming some of my studies in a more organised way so I spent a long time reading and learning about [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). I need to get a decent microphone as I'm getting way too many background noise with my built-in one during my hangout sessions. Yeah, I got side tracked because of this... I could have spent some extra time studying and building things but teaching became an important thing for me during these 100 days of code.

### R1D31
Today I studied a bit more of Functional Programming basics and joined a pair programming session of a React App. I also read and discussed a bit about modules in ES6 with [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O). And tried to help him centralising a modal with CSS.

### R1D30
Today I finally managed to push my Random Quote Machine versions to my [old git repo](https://goo.gl/mhpHGs). It's there now... let's see if I get feedbacks :P I also read a bit more of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and studied a bit of VueJS.

### R1D29
Today I read a bit more of [@YDKJS]((https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and had a pair programming session with a React app. I also refactored all my Random Quote Machine github repo and moved all my codepen versions (Vanilla JS, React and VueJS) to it. There was also a partial jQuery version on it which I'll have to finish. It's all broken... I'll fix these things this week.

### R1D28
Today I read a bit more of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS) and studied a lot about VueJS. I'm still trying to make my Random Quote Machine app work in the Vue version. I'll try to make it work fully in the following days.

### R1D27 
Today I studied a bit of Functional Programming and read another chapter of [@YDKJS](https://twitter.com/YDKJS). I didn't have my computer with me so I did what I could with my mobile only :P

### R1D26 
Today I studied a bit more of Functional Programming (Monads and Ternaries). I also did a Pair Programming session with a React app and this time I was driving! I'm way more inexperienced (threfore slower) than the other developers but I was quite happy that they encouraged me to keep working on it.

### R1D25
Today I worked with [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O) to get his Simon game working. We got there in the end! I also studied Functional Programming, Transducer Protocol and I had another pair programming session on a React App. I read a bit of You don't know JS.

### R1D24
Today I worked with [@Isaac_Sogunro](https://twitter.com/Isaac_Sogunro) on a VueJS app he is working on. We found the bug and he got the app working! Hurray! I also studied Functional Programming, Transducers. And had another pair programming session on a React App. I was so tired that I fell asleep and didn't have time to log my progress nor tweet about it.

### R1D23
Today I worked a bit more on my [second Portfolio Page for FreeCodeCamp](https://codepen.io/gepetobio/full/YYYBgP/) and also had a chat with [Marilzon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marilzon/) about his career path. I finally put some words on my [Functiona Programming with JavaScript Resources](https://github.com/gepetobio/functional-programming-with-javascript-resources) repo and pushed to master! That was quite cool! I also studied a bit about Drupal and PHP OOP but that was for my work... not sure if I should add this here. But hey, I was studying anyway!

### R1D22
Today I made some progress on my Vue version of the Random Quote Machine app. I still need to pass the props but the structure seems to be ok. I also studied Functiona Programming, Software Composition and had a pair programming session on a React/Redux app.

### R1D21
Today I kept studying Curry and Partial application. I also studied a bit of Streams, Promises and Monads. I also did a code review on [@super_raay](https://twitter.com/super_raay) Number Facts app and suggested some changes.

### R1D20
Today I studied a bit of Curry and Partial application. As I had to travel, I listened to 3 episodes of Software Engineering Daily Poodcast about WebAssembly, Reactive Programming and React.

### R1D19
Today I studied Functional Programming (Abstraction & Composition). I also had a long React debug session and learned a bit more about reducers and transducers. I also started migrating my several versions of Random Quote Machine app to a github repository (which I should have done in the first place but ended up doing on codepen just because FCC asks for it). Also did some map and filter exercises.

### R1D18
Today I revisited the usage of `this` in JavaScript and the perks of using it with ES6 arrow functions. I also studied Functional Programming, the differences between compose and pipe and their applications. Had a long debugging session in a React project. Also had a look at the Vue documentation to undertsand how components and props work comparing with React.

### R1D17
Today I revisited some basic concepts of Functional Programming: function composition, higher order functions, curry and partial application. I also revisited some ES6 features. An ddid a bit of code review with [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O) on his tic tac toe game.

### R1D16
Today I refactored finished my Vanilla JavaScript Quote Machine app and closed the FCC challenge. I also refactored my React version and made the share link work properly. I've also started reading the documentation for a Vue version I'm starting.

### R1D15
Today I kept working on my Vanilla JavaScript Quote Machine app. It works, I just need to sort out the sharing button now. I tried to apply some of the Functional Programming concepts I've been learning (e.g. trying to contain all the side effects and make functions I could do unit tests easily). I'm glad I did the first (and second) versions of this app in React and now I'm getting back to basics just to see how I could solve the same problem in different ways (and different tools).

### R1D14
Today I got busy with other things and had to drive a lot. As I knew I wouldn't be able to code much, I spent almost 4h of driving listening to Javascript - Software Engineering Daily Podcast. [@sarah_edo](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) [@kylemathews](https://twitter.com/kylemathews) and [@getify](https://twitter.com/getify) episodes. After that, I got home and decided to build my Quote Machine app in Vanilla JavaScript and in Vue. The plan is to use it as a case study when I have to teach JavaScript to my students.

### R1D13
Today I just studied Monads (and invariably studied Functors). I think I'm getting the the application of it, just need to understand the laws of Monads now. But I'm happier now that I'm seeing the light in the end of the tunnel :P

### R1D12
Today I refactored my Random Quote Machine app (actually, I created a second version of it but kept the first for future reference). After some constructive feedback, I saw that I could do better with Pure Functions so that's why I refactored. There's still room for improvement, though. I also studied the laws of Monads and fried my brain. Functors and Monads have been the toughest topics in Functional Programming so far (not that I already know all about the rest of Functional Programming). No hangouts today again... I'll try on again next week.

### R1D11
Today I kept working on my Random Quote Machine app. It's working with React and I managed to apply a bit of the Functional Programming knowleged I got so far. I still need to polish it as it's too rough but the main functionalities are working!!! I also studied Functional Programming (Functors and Monads Laws) and my brain fried a bit. But I'll get there! Couldn't do my hangout session again but I'll try to do it tomorrow!

### R1D10
Today I started my Random Quote Machine app... scrapped the jQuery version and now I'm transforming it in a React app. Worked more on markup and styles. No functionality available for now. Also studied Functional Programming (Functors and Monads). Exchanged some ideas with [@Isaac_Sogunro](https://twitter.com/Isaac_Sogunro) on an app he's working on and kept working on a Portfolio page to help [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O) with HTML and CSS. No public hangout session today though :-(

### R1D9
Today I studied React, built some components and learned some new tricks. Started reading the book `Functional-Light Javascript` and kept working on a second Portfolio page on a hangout session. 

### R1D8
Today I studied Functional Programming (Maps, Functors and a bit of Monads) – and that was intense on its own! I also studied a bit more about Redux and authentication. I finished building my FCC portfolio page (a bit of a partial copy of my real portfolio website), helped [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O) with some HTML and CSS demo (building yet another FCC Portfolio page) on another hangout session.

### R1D7
Today I managed to refactor my piece of code from yesterday and it works without bugs! Tests all green, hurray! Also started to build my FCC portfolio page. I've been sharing a google hangout link for the last 4 or 5 days and today I met some cool guys!

### R1D6
Today I studied a bit of Functional Programming and worked on refactoring a piece of code that I wasn't happy with. I failed: found a bug on the original code, couldn't fix it and I'm still not happy with it. Least productive day so far :-(

### R1D5
Today I studied TDD, React/Redux configuration, Functional Programming, worked on a FCC algorithm (struggled with it tbh) and managed to meet [@Isaac_Sogunro](https://twitter.com/Isaac_Sogunro) and work on a project of his! Most productive and fun day so far!

### R1D4
Today I studied Functional Programming, Declarative vs Imperative programming, Object Composition (Delegation), React (unit tests, redux and authentication) and worked on a couple of JavaScript algorithms on FreeCodeCamp. Didn't touch my React game though :-(

### R1D3
Today I studied Object Composition again, Concatenation. Also studied about environment configuration for app development (.env). And practiced a bit of Functional Programming and ES6 on https://babeljs.io/repl

### R1D2
A bit of Functional Programming (Pure Functions and Higher Order Functions) and a lot of trouble with my React game but all fun! Quickly prototyping and refactoring the ugly bits of yesterday.

### R1D1 
Started studying Object Composition in JavaScript (Aggregation vs Concatenation). Also learned a bit about Redux, reducers and redux saga. Also started a simple React game, borrowing the idea from an old Flash game example I saw in a book some 9 years ago. I'll probably use this game when I start teaching React to my students. So far it looks horrible :-(
