# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Gledsley MÃ¼ller

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 1st, Monday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 

Started studying Object Composition in JavaScript (Aggregation vs Concatenation). Also learned a bit about Redux, reducers and redux saga. Also started a simple React game, borrowing the idea from an old Flash game example I saw in a book some 9 years ago. I'll probably use this game when I start teaching React to my students. So far it looks horrible :-(

### R1D2
A bit of Functional Programming (Pure Functions and Higher Order Functions) and a lot of trouble with my React game but all fun! Quickly prototyping and refactoring the ugly bits of yesterday.

### R1D3
Today I studied Object Composition again, Concatenation. Also studied about environment configuration for app development (.env). And practiced a bit of Functional Programming and ES6 on https://babeljs.io/repl

### R1D4
Today I studied Functional Programming, Declarative vs Imperative programming, Object Composition (Delegation), React (unit tests, redux and authentication) and worked on a couple of JavaScript algorithms on FreeCodeCamp. Didn't touch my React game though :-(

### R1D5
Today I studied TDD, React/Redux configuration, Functional Programming, worked on a FCC algorithm (struggled with it tbh) and managed to meet @Isaac_Sogunro and work on a project of his! Most productive and fun day so far!
