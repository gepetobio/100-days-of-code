# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Gledsley Müller

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 1st, Monday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 

Started studying Object Composition in JavaScript (Aggregation vs Concatenation). Also learned a bit about Redux, reducers and redux saga. Also started a simple React game, borrowing the idea from an old Flash game example I saw in a book some 9 years ago. I'll probably use this game when I start teaching React to my students. So far it looks horrible :-(

### R1D2
A bit of Functional Programming (Pure Functions and Higher Order Functions) and a lot of trouble with my React game but all fun! Quickly prototyping and refactoring the ugly bits of yesterday.

### R1D3
Today I studied Object Composition again, Concatenation. Also studied about environment configuration for app development (.env). And practiced a bit of Functional Programming and ES6 on https://babeljs.io/repl

### R1D4
Today I studied Functional Programming, Declarative vs Imperative programming, Object Composition (Delegation), React (unit tests, redux and authentication) and worked on a couple of JavaScript algorithms on FreeCodeCamp. Didn't touch my React game though :-(

### R1D5
Today I studied TDD, React/Redux configuration, Functional Programming, worked on a FCC algorithm (struggled with it tbh) and managed to meet @Isaac_Sogunro and work on a project of his! Most productive and fun day so far!

### R1D6
Today I studied a bit of Functional Programming and worked on refactoring a piece of code that I wasn't happy with. I failed: found a bug on the original code, couldn't fix it and I'm still not happy with it. Least productive day so far :-(

### R1D7
Today I managed to refactor my piece of code from yesterday and it works without bugs! Tests all green, hurray! Also started to build my FCC portfolio page. I've been sharing a google hangout link for the last 4 or 5 days and today I met some cool guys!

### R1D8
Today I studied Functional Programming (Maps, Functors and a bit of Monads) – and that was intense on its own! I also studied a bit more about Redux and authentication. I finished building my FCC portfolio page (a bit of a partial copy of my real portfolio website), helped @artoo_O with some HTML and CSS demo (building yet another FCC Portfolio page) on another hangout session.

### R1D9
Today I studied React, built some components and learned some new tricks. Started reading the book `Functional-Light Javascript` and kept working on a second Portfolio page on a hangout session. 

### R1D10
Today I started my Random Quote Machine app... scrapped the jQuery version and now I'm transforming it in a React app. Worked more on markup and styles. No functionality available for now. Also studied Functional Programming (Functors and Monads). Exchanged some ideas with @Isaac_Sogunro on an app he's working on and kept working on a Portfolio page to help @artoo_O with HTML and CSS. No public hangout session today though :-(

### R1D11
Today I kept working on my Random Quote Machine app. It's working with React and I managed to apply a bit of the Functional Programming knowleged I got so far. I still need to polish it as it's too rough but the main functionalities are working!!! I also studied Functional Programming (Functors and Monads Laws) and my brain fried a bit. But I'll get there! Couldn't do my hangout session again but I'll try to do it tomorrow!

### R1D12
Today I refactored my Random Quote Machine app (actually, I created a second version of it but kept the first for future reference). After some constructive feedback, I saw that I could do better with Pure Functions so that's why I refactored. There's still room for improvement, though. I also studied the laws of Monads and fried my brain. Functors and Monads have been the toughest topics in Functional Programming so far (not that I already know all about the rest of Functional Programming). No hangouts today again... I'll try on again next week.
