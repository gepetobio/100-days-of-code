# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Gledsley MÃ¼ller

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 1st, Monday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 

Started studying Object Composition in JavaScript (Aggregation vs Concatenation). Also learned a bit about Redux, reducers and redux saga. Also started a simple React game, borrowing the idea from an old Flash game example I saw in a book some 9 years ago. I'll probably use this game when I start teaching React to my students. So far it looks horrible :-(

### R1D2
A bit of Functional Programming (Pure Functions and Higher Order Functions) and a lot of trouble with my React game but all fun! Quickly prototyping and refactoring the ugly bits of yesterday.
