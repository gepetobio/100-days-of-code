# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Gledsley Müller

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 1st, Monday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 

Started studying Object Composition in JavaScript (Aggregation vs Concatenation). Also learned a bit about Redux, reducers and redux saga. Also started a simple React game, borrowing the idea from an old Flash game example I saw in a book some 9 years ago. I'll probably use this game when I start teaching React to my students. So far it looks horrible :-(

### R1D2
A bit of Functional Programming (Pure Functions and Higher Order Functions) and a lot of trouble with my React game but all fun! Quickly prototyping and refactoring the ugly bits of yesterday.

### R1D3
Today I studied Object Composition again, Concatenation. Also studied about environment configuration for app development (.env). And practiced a bit of Functional Programming and ES6 on https://babeljs.io/repl

### R1D4
Today I studied Functional Programming, Declarative vs Imperative programming, Object Composition (Delegation), React (unit tests, redux and authentication) and worked on a couple of JavaScript algorithms on FreeCodeCamp. Didn't touch my React game though :-(

### R1D5
Today I studied TDD, React/Redux configuration, Functional Programming, worked on a FCC algorithm (struggled with it tbh) and managed to meet [@Isaac_Sogunro](https://twitter.com/Isaac_Sogunro) and work on a project of his! Most productive and fun day so far!

### R1D6
Today I studied a bit of Functional Programming and worked on refactoring a piece of code that I wasn't happy with. I failed: found a bug on the original code, couldn't fix it and I'm still not happy with it. Least productive day so far :-(

### R1D7
Today I managed to refactor my piece of code from yesterday and it works without bugs! Tests all green, hurray! Also started to build my FCC portfolio page. I've been sharing a google hangout link for the last 4 or 5 days and today I met some cool guys!

### R1D8
Today I studied Functional Programming (Maps, Functors and a bit of Monads) – and that was intense on its own! I also studied a bit more about Redux and authentication. I finished building my FCC portfolio page (a bit of a partial copy of my real portfolio website), helped [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O) with some HTML and CSS demo (building yet another FCC Portfolio page) on another hangout session.

### R1D9
Today I studied React, built some components and learned some new tricks. Started reading the book `Functional-Light Javascript` and kept working on a second Portfolio page on a hangout session. 

### R1D10
Today I started my Random Quote Machine app... scrapped the jQuery version and now I'm transforming it in a React app. Worked more on markup and styles. No functionality available for now. Also studied Functional Programming (Functors and Monads). Exchanged some ideas with [@Isaac_Sogunro](https://twitter.com/Isaac_Sogunro) on an app he's working on and kept working on a Portfolio page to help [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O) with HTML and CSS. No public hangout session today though :-(

### R1D11
Today I kept working on my Random Quote Machine app. It's working with React and I managed to apply a bit of the Functional Programming knowleged I got so far. I still need to polish it as it's too rough but the main functionalities are working!!! I also studied Functional Programming (Functors and Monads Laws) and my brain fried a bit. But I'll get there! Couldn't do my hangout session again but I'll try to do it tomorrow!

### R1D12
Today I refactored my Random Quote Machine app (actually, I created a second version of it but kept the first for future reference). After some constructive feedback, I saw that I could do better with Pure Functions so that's why I refactored. There's still room for improvement, though. I also studied the laws of Monads and fried my brain. Functors and Monads have been the toughest topics in Functional Programming so far (not that I already know all about the rest of Functional Programming). No hangouts today again... I'll try on again next week.

### R1D13
Today I just studied Monads (and invariably studied Functors). I think I'm getting the the application of it, just need to understand the laws of Monads now. But I'm happier now that I'm seeing the light in the end of the tunnel :P

### R1D14
Today I got busy with other things and had to drive a lot. As I knew I wouldn't be able to code much, I spent almost 4h of driving listening to Javascript - Software Engineering Daily Podcast. [@sarah_edo](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) [@kylemathews](https://twitter.com/kylemathews) and [@getify](https://twitter.com/getify) episodes. After that, I got home and decided to build my Quote Machine app in Vanilla JavaScript and in Vue. The plan is to use it as a case study when I have to teach JavaScript to my students.

### R1D15
Today I kept working on my Vanilla JavaScript Quote Machine app. It works, I just need to sort out the sharing button now. I tried to apply some of the Functional Programming concepts I've been learning (e.g. trying to contain all the side effects and make functions I could do unit tests easily). I'm glad I did the first (and second) versions of this app in React and now I'm getting back to basics just to see how I could solve the same problem in different ways (and different tools).

### R1D16
Today I refactored finished my Vanilla JavaScript Quote Machine app and closed the FCC challenge. I also refactored my React version and made the share link work properly. I've also started reading the documentation for a Vue version I'm starting.

### R1D17
Today I revisited some basic concepts of Functional Programming: function composition, higher order functions, curry and partial application. I also revisited some ES6 features. An ddid a bit of code review with [@artoo_O](https://twitter.com/artoo_O) on his tic tac toe game.

### R1D18
Today I revisited the usage of `this` in JavaScript and the perks of using it with ES6 arrow functions. I also studied Functional Programming, the differences between compose and pipe and their applications. Had a long debugging session in a React project. Also had a look at the Vue documentation to undertsand how components and props work comparing with React.

### R1D19
Today I studied Functional Programming (Abstraction & Composition). I also had a long React debug session and learned a bit more about reducers and transducers. I also started migrating my several versions of Random Quote Machine app to a github repository (which I should have done in the first place but ended up doing on codepen just because FCC asks for it). Also did some map and filter exercises.

### R1D20
Today I studied a bit of Curry and Partial application. As I had to travel, I listened to 3 episodes of Software Engineering Daily Poodcast about WebAssembly, Reactive Programming and React.

### R1D21
Today I kept studying Curry and Partial application. I also studied a bit of Streams, Promises and Monads. I also did a code review on [@super_raay](https://twitter.com/super_raay) Number Facts app and suggested some changes.

### R1D22
Today I made some progress on my Vue version of the Random Quote Machine app. I still need to pass the props but the structure seems to be ok. I also studied Functiona Programming, Software Composition and had a pair programming session on a React/Redux app.

### R1D23
Today I worked a bit more on my [second Portfolio Page for FreeCodeCamp](https://codepen.io/gepetobio/full/YYYBgP/) and also had a chat with [Marilzon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marilzon/) about his career path. I finally put some words on my [Functiona Programming with JavaScript Resources](https://github.com/gepetobio/functional-programming-with-javascript-resources) repo and pushed to master! That was quite cool! I also studied a bit about Drupal and PHP OOP but that was for my work... not sure if I should add this here. But hey, I was studying anyway!

### R1D24
Today I worked with [@Isaac_Sogunro](https://twitter.com/Isaac_Sogunro) on a VueJS app he is working on. We found the bug and he got the app working! Hurray! I also studied Functional Programming, Transducers. And had another pair programming session on a React App. I was so tired that I fell asleep and didn't have time to log my progress nor tweet about it.
